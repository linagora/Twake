# üçé Applications

#### Description

**Applications** is everything related to connectors in Twake.

An application is described by an identity sheet containing this information:

- **Identity** \(name, description, logo\)
- **API** **preferences** \(Twake‚ÜíConnector events endpoint, API id and secret, and Connector‚ÜíTwake allowed IPs\)
- **Privileges and capabilities** \(List of things the connector can read and can write\)
- **Display information** \(Where the connector is visible, button in chat, configuration in application list etc\)

This is all we need to define a connector.

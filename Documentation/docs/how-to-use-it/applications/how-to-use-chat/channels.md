# Channels

## Create a channel

To create a channel, you must have `Administrator` rights for the workspace in question. 

{% page-ref page="../../company-and-workspace/rights.md" %}

To create your channel, click on the `+` button right to the "Channel" inscription. Fill a name for your channel, select a wonderful emoji and select if it is a public or private channel \(by default, channels are private\).

## Channel sections

You can organize your channel by grouping them. If you are `Administrator`, you can drag a channel and drop in the section you want `Add here` or in `New group`. 

To edit section name, you just have to click on it, change the name and press `Enter`

## Public channel

Public channels are visible to all members of the workspace.

## Private channel

Private channels are channels accessible only to a limited number of users. Members not present in these channels cannot see them.

## External member

You have the possibility to invite external members to your channel. External members are members who are not in the workspace and who are added to one, or more,  specific channel\(s\). 

This feature is useful for inviting users who are not in your company. Freelancers, for example, can be added to a specific channel to collaborate on a project. They will only have access to this channel, they will not see public channels.
